<p>My journey to the data science field started in a circuits class during my undergrad at BYU. I fell in love with the math that defined the natural processes around us. I wasn't so jazzed about designing chips all day and so I pivoted majors, joining the Applied and Computational Mathematics degree (a.k.a. <a href="https://acme.byu.edu">ACME</a>). In this program, I was exposed to computational theories and then applied them using Python. I gained a large breadth of knowledge concerning the mathematics that underly many of the methods used to day such as unsupervised learning, search algorithms, fourier transforms, convex and non-convex optimization, cybersecurity, statistical theory and more. Statistical methods and machine learning fascinated me most, which led me to get a minor in Computer Science and pursue a master's degree in Statistics.</p>
